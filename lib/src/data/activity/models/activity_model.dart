/// `ActivityModel` is a data model that represents an activity (post) within
/// the application. It is responsible for mapping JSON data from the server
/// into a Dart object and vice versa. This model also supports conversion to
/// its corresponding entity, `ActivityEntity`, which is used within the domain layer.
///
/// This class uses the `equatable` package to enable value comparisons, and
/// `json_annotation` for JSON serialization. It also includes custom JSON
/// converters, such as `DateTimeUTCConverter`, to handle specific formatting
/// requirements like UTC DateTime serialization.
///
/// Dependencies:
/// - `equatable`: For value equality.
/// - `json_annotation`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
/// - `FeedId`: Model used to represent feeds associated with the activity.
/// - `DateTimeUTCConverter`: Custom converter to ensure DateTime is handled in UTC.
/// - `ActivityEntity`: Domain-level entity corresponding to this model.

@JsonSerializable()
@DateTimeUTCConverter() // Custom converter for DateTime
class ActivityModel extends Equatable {
  /// Constructor for creating an `ActivityModel` with all fields.
  /// Many fields are optional, allowing for flexible instantiation.
  ///
  /// Parameters:
  /// - [actor]: The user or entity performing the activity, formatted as "User:username".
  /// - [verb]: The action being performed (e.g., "post").
  /// - [object]: The object of the action (e.g., "Post:1").
  /// - [id]: Optional. Unique identifier for the activity.
  /// - [foreignId]: Optional. Unique identifier to distinguish duplicate activities.
  /// - [target]: Optional. Specifies the target of the activity, if any.
  /// - [time]: Optional. The timestamp of the activity.
  /// - [to]: Optional. A list of feeds where this activity is sent.
  /// - [analytics]: Optional. Additional analytics data associated with the activity.
  /// - [extraContext]: Optional. Extra contextual information for the activity.
  /// - [origin]: Optional. Specifies the origin of the activity.
  /// - [score]: Optional. Score associated with the activity.
  /// - [extraData]: Optional. Any additional data relevant to the activity.
  /// - [message]: Optional. A message associated with the activity, if any.
  /// - [reactionCounts]: Optional. A map of reactions counts associated with the activity.
  /// - [latestReactions]: Optional. A map of latest reactions for the activity.
  /// - [latestReactionsExtra]: Optional. Extra metadata for the latest reactions.
